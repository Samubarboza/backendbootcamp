# Backend Bootcamp – Rick and Morty API

This project is a simple backend application built for a programming bootcamp.

The goal of the project is to learn **backend fundamentals** by building a real application that:

- Consumes data from an external API (Rick and Morty API)
- Processes that data in the backend
- Sends the data to the frontend to be displayed in HTML

This project focuses on **understanding how backend works**, not on complex design or advanced features.

## What does this app do?

- Requests character data from the Rick and Morty public API
- Handles the data on the backend
- Renders the information in a simple web page

## Main objective

Help students understand:
- What a backend is
- What an API is and how to consume it
- How frontend and backend communicate
- How data flows from an external API to the browser
